          Because our services are digital and performance-based, we have established the following refund policy to ensure a clear understanding between our agency and our clients.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-gray-900 font-semibold text-2xl">1. General Policy</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-2">
          At Developers Street, we provide professional services including web development, design, and consulting. Unlike physical goods, digital services involve human labor, expertise, and time. Therefore, refunds are only issued under specific circumstances as outlined in this policy.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-gray-900 font-semibold text-2xl">2. Milestone-Based Refunds</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-2">
          Most of our projects are divided into specific milestones (e.g., Discovery, Design, Development, Testing).
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2 mt-3">
          <li><strong>Completed Milestones:</strong> Once a milestone is completed, reviewed, and approved by the client, the payments associated with that milestone are non-refundable.</li>
          <li><strong>In-Progress Milestones:</strong> If a project is cancelled during an active milestone, Developers Street reserves the right to retain a portion of the payment proportional to the work already completed.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-gray-900 font-semibold text-2xl">3. Eligibility for a Refund</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-2">
          You may be eligible for a partial or full refund if:

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2 mt-3">
          <li>The project has not yet started and no resources have been allocated.</li>
          <li>We are unable to complete the project due to unforeseen internal reasons.</li>
          <li>The service delivered deviates significantly from the agreed-upon Scope of Work (SOW) and we are unable to rectify the issue after a reasonable number of attempts.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-gray-900 font-semibold text-2xl">4. Non-Refundable Scenarios</h2>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-600 space-y-2 mt-3">
          <li><strong>Change of Mind:</strong> If you decide to cancel the project for reasons unrelated to the quality of our work.</li>
          <li><strong>Third-Party Costs:</strong> Any fees paid for hosting, domain registration, premium plugins, or third-party APIs are non-refundable.</li>
          <li><strong>Delayed Feedback:</strong> Delays in the project caused by the client's failure to provide necessary information, content, or approvals.</li>
          <li><strong>Post-Launch:</strong> Once a website or application has been moved to a live environment or the final source code has been delivered, no refunds will be issued.</li>
